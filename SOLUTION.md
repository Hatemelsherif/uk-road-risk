   - **Solution**: Enhanced error handling + automatic fallback to sample data
   - **Result**: System works regardless of Kaggle connectivity issues

2. **✅ TensorFlow Apple Silicon Mutex Lock Issues**
   - **Problem**: TensorFlow causing mutex lock failures on M3 Max, training hanging at 40%
   - **Solution**: Implemented PyTorch with MPS backend as TensorFlow alternative
   - **Result**: Native Apple Silicon deep learning with 5 neural network architectures

3. **✅ Orphaned Training Process Issues**  
   - **Problem**: 21 orphaned joblib workers consuming 60-99% CPU each
   - **Solution**: Comprehensive process management system with automatic cleanup
   - **Result**: Safe, interruptible training with zero orphaned processes

4. **✅ FutureWarning in Model Performance**
   - **Problem**: Pandas deprecation warning for 'M' frequency
   - **Solution**: Updated to use 'ME' instead
   - **Result**: No more deprecation warnings

5. **✅ Date Format Issues**  
   - **Problem**: Date parsing errors with UK date format (DD/MM/YYYY)
   - **Solution**: Added `dayfirst=True` parameter to pandas date parsing
   - **Result**: Correct date handling for UK format

6. **✅ Missing Model Artifacts**
   - **Problem**: "Model artifacts not found" warnings
   - **Solution**: Created enhanced training pipeline with multiple algorithms
